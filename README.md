# Grocery List
### Project Overview
Everyone needs to go grocery shopping. And when you go grocery shopping, you need a list. Wouldn’t it be great if there was an online option? Of course it would! The company of Shop Lift Up, Inc. wants you to write and design their grocery list web based utility. Broke and in need of a job, you’ve accepted.

### Display
The list below includes the essential elements of the page.

● Shop Lift Up, Inc. requires that their logo be on the page. Their last logo was banned by
Federal Trade Commission so you’ll have to find one for them (you may download
something or design one yourself).

● The page needs the list of all of the groceries the user plans to buy.

● The page needs a way for the user to add new groceries to the list.

● The page needs a way for the user to organize the list by moving groceries up and down.

● The page needs a button or icon so that an item can be deleted from the list.

● The page should be intuitive and attractive

### Enhancements
● No Duplicates: If you try to add an item to the list that’s already there, it shouldn’t allow it.
